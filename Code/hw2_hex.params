Notes:

1)  Selection Type Codes    1 = Proportional Selection
							2 = Tournament Selection
							3 = Random Selection
							4 = Rank Selection

2)  Fitness Scaling Type    0 = Scale for Maximization (no change to raw fitness)
							1 = Scale for Minimization (reciprocal of raw fitness)
							2 = Rank for Maximization
							3 = Rank for Minimization

3)  Crossover Type Codes    1 = Single Point Crossover
							2 = Two Point Crossover
							3 = Uniform Crossover

4)  Crossover Rates from 0 to 1, Use "0" to turn off crossover

5)  Mutation Type Codes     0 = No Mutation
							1 = Flip Bit

6)  Mutation Rates from 0 to 1, Use "0" to turn off mutation

7)	Represents number of genes in each chromosome.

8)	Determines number of bits in each gene.  Number of Genes times Size
	gives the number of bits in each chromosome.
9)  Fitness Evaluation Function  0 for Euclidean and 1 for Manhatten distance
